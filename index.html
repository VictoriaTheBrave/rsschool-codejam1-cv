        <p>
            I'm 24 years old and by now I know for sure what I want to achive in my life. 
            My purpose is to become a real profesional in Web-programming. 
            I don't have any core IT-education but I'm sure that it's a feature, not a bug. 
            I'm a customs broker in the past, I worked as waitress during my study at University and I have a good variety of experience. 
            My soft skills are good and I have broad-based knowledge. 
            The learning prospects in my past career were not really good. 
            I learned all I needed there in a year. 
            The possibility to learn is actually the main advantage of any IT-career. 
            I like to learn and do it really fast so I learn Java Script with pleasure. 
            My English level is not lower than Intermediate, I speak Spanish too (just need some practice). 
            I think I'll be very decent candidate for a Junior Developer Job.
            And I'll do my best to improve my technical skills and be up to the job perfectly well.
